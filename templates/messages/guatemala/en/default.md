Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed that you have made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap-OSM in Guatemala. Congratulations and thank you! From now on you can consider yourself part of the OSM Guatemala community. Your edits are already in the database, but some of them may not be visible in the maps yet. You have to wait a bit, or refresh your browser.

I tell you that you have started this journey into the world of OpenStreetMap, where you will discover many things. You will see that it is very interesting.

To start, here are some interesting links:

* We recommend you first read the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page). There you will find all the basic information you need to get started. All of us map contributors continuously read the Wiki; and if something is not well explained or applies differently in our region, we document it there.
* In Guatemala, we have a [Guide to map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:Guatemala#Ingreso_de_Datos) that explains in detail what needs to be mapped and some guidelines to help you do it. We recommend you to read it, by doing this that you will be more aware of what and how things need to be done.
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org/en/) is a good place to learn about the OSM world. Here you will find instructions for the iD editor (which you can use from the web browser) and for a more advanced editor called JOSM (Java Application).
* If in the editor you are using, you can't find how to map something, the quickest solution is to look it up on the wiki [map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) page. This will list and show everything that can be added to the map. At first, this may seem to be a huge list, but it will provide you wiith the needed knowledge be able to figure out how to improve the map. Keep in mind that not everything that can be mapped is valid for Guatemala; this is why we suggest you to check the guide first.
* If you have a web page which you may want to incorporate with the OpenStreetMap map, you may check [this](https://switch2osm.org/) site.
* To find other editors contributing to the map near where you are editing, you may consult [here](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/oooc) by scrolling to the location you are in.  You will find hundreds of people working on this project - some very near you!

Should you ever have any doubts or questions such as these following examples:

* “Have I damaged something?”
* “How do I map something I can't find in the wiki map features?”

You may make contact with the local community:
* The OpenStreetMap community in Guatemala has a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/openstreetmapGT/1), where you may ask any specific questions or learn about their upcoming activities. It is a space where members usually discuss things around the map. You can start by greeting the community, introducing yourself and sharing your interest in OSM.
* There is also a much larger OSM communication platform named [Discourse](https://community.openstreetmap.org/), where you may ask anything map related, and have a much wider audience.
* The Guatemala community is currently forming a group (to be called: ‘Mapeando Ando Guatemala’) which will organize periodic meetings around some cities in the country and to be able to map the different areas around the country. This is an excellent opportunity for beginners like yourself to get involved, as we explain everything right from the very beginning. Don't miss out on the upcomming events. You may also contact us through [Telegram](https://t.me/openstreetmapGT/6413).
* On the other hand, if you want to request the addition of a business, without having to know the mapping details, you may use [this](https://www.onosm.org/) tool.

You may NOW be wondering: - “what should I map now?” We recommend you start by adding things that are close to you and you know well enough, such as: Buildings (houses, buildings); stores (restaurants, hairdressers), roads, sidewalks and pedestrian paths; chairs/benches. You are the real expert within your area! If you run into a business on the map has been already mapped, you can complete the data by adding the address, opening hours, social networks (using the proper formats for these). You will find how much fun it is to fill the map with new updated details.

You may also use other useful applications such as [EveryDoor](https://every-door.app/) or [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) to add onto the map using your cell phone. [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/) is yet another very useful tool which will allow you to share geolocated sequential imagery with the OSM world - where the (sequential or single) imagery you upload appears located on the map so you may edit other features that may have escaped your sight (or your memory) as you pass through an area. The OpenStreetMap environment has apps & new tools appearing constantly that will benefit you directly and ease the tasks of building maps.

Finally, please reply take a moment reply to this message and/or join the listed local community channels so we can get to know you better and all your specific interests, so that then we can work together to start building a better and up-to-date map in benefit of all.

Enjoy the mapping!

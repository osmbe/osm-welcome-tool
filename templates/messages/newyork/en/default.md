Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed you made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap. Congratulations, and thanks! As of now, you can consider yourself part of the US OSM community. Your edit is live within a couple of minutes. You may have to refresh your browser to see your edit.

If you have any questions at all, we can help out: if you think you might have broken something, are in doubt how to map something particular, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, contact us!

Here are some useful things to get you started:

* OpenStreetMap's US Chapter runs a [Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/) server.  Slack is a collaboration tool for OSM mappers, organizers, and developers.  Slack even has our own #local-newyorkstate channel where you can chat with other New York mappers. This is a very active forum and the best way to get in touch with other local mappers in New York and the rest of the United States.
* I highly recommend using the OSM [wiki-pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). If you're not sure how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki. For more complicated questions you can ask/search on the [forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org/) or the #tagging channel on Slack.
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM. Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.
* Want to see who’s mapping near you, or want to see how much you’ve been doing yourself, check out the maps at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).
* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

So what should you map next? I highly recommend adding features around you. Restaurants, business, streets, sidewalks, benches, basically features that you know best. You are the expert. If you find a business already mapped, make sure there is an address. There is something satisfying about filling in the map around you. Or correcting a road when the local government makes changes to it. Do you have any special interests, like biking, hiking, or even trains? Did you know we have the best bike, hiking and train world wide networks of any site. But like everything else, they can always use improvements.

Happy Mapping!

Hi {{ mapper.displayName }},

Welcome to OpenStreetMap, we thank you very much for your edit and we hope you keep editing.
OpenStreetMap is an open source map, and anyone can edit and improve it.
We will be glad to have you as an ongoing editor helping to improve the map of Iraq, and make it better and better.

If you want to ask something, have a question, or just share your experience, ideas for improvement and suggestions, we would be happy to meet you in the Iraqi editors telegram group, talk to us.

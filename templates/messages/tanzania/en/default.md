Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I saw that you made your first edit on OpenStreetMap. Congratulations and thank you! You're now a member of the OpenStreetMap community.

There is a vibrant mapping community in Tanzania with both remote and field mapping.  Organisations include [Crowd2Map](https://crowd2map.org/), [OMDTZ](https://www.omdtz.or.tz/) and many different [Youthmapper](https://www.youthmappers.org/) and various community groups. We have a [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/crowd2map/shared_invite/zt-q04pcgqp-oiICJUFnp61Czn5vguV_Ig) where you can get feedback on your mapping in English, and try quizzes to get badges, and a [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/HJA5YYtLqfOLMiwXrF7NWb) that organises training sessions in Swahili via zoom. Previous session recordings are here.

If you've got any questions, we can help you: if you think you broke something, don't know for sure how to map something, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, you can [contact us](https://crowd2map.org/contact-us/)

Here's some help to get you started:

- You can find a lot of information about how to map on the wiki.
- If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term] with your favourite search engine.
- A good start is always to check first if there is no error in the area you want to map, so you know if the error is made by you or a previous mapper ([documentation](https://learnosm.org/en/hot-tips/issues/#warnings-from-id-(issues))). You can enable this feature with I key.
- When you save your changeset, add a clear comment on what you have changed ([documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
- Do not connect landuse to highway, a field does not cover the road; leave a small empty area between the two.

If you have any question, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://crowd2map.org/contact-us/)

There's also a [global weekly newsletter about the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/) you can subscribe to.

Happy Mapping!

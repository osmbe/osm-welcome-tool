Hi {{ mapper.displayName }},

Welcome to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Montenegro {{ region.flag }} community! We noticed that you made your first edit on OpenStreetMap. Congratulations and thank you!

I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, an OSM cartographer and member of OSM Montenegro!

If your contribution was just sporadic, that's okay! Maybe you know someone around you who enjoys hiking, biking, or is just passionate about maps? We would be happy if you told them about OpenStreetMap!

In addition to contributing to the map, you can help us by: uploading GPS tracks, reporting errors, or promoting OpenStreetMap.

If you have any questions, or just want to share your experience or ideas for improvement, join us on Telegram over at: [OpenStreetMap Montenegro](https://t.me/osm_mne).

Here's some helpful links to get you started:

* [Welcome Mat](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/): gives a good overview of the "Who? What? Why? How?" regarding OpenStreetMap. 
* [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/): the main source of information on how exactly to map stuff (tags, standards, possibilities, etc).
If want to find out how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to use the search template: `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]`, with your favourite search engine.
* An overview of the Montenegro mapping project can be found on the OSM Wiki as well: [WikiProject Montenegro](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Montenegro)
It has helpful links as well, next to the current state and goals of mapping in Montenegro! And a lot of other stuff too! In English and Montenegrin!
* Wondering what commit message you should write when saving changes to OSM? See: [Good changeset comments on OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments).

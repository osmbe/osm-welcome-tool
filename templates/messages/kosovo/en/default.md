Hi {{ mapper.displayName }},

Thank you for your first contribution to OpenStreetMap!

We warmly welcome you to the community of enthusiasts who have been integrating and improving the map for several years, and we hope you'll get hooked and continue contributing for a long time to come.

If your contribution is sporadic, it doesn't matter! Maybe you know someone around you who enjoys hiking, biking, or is just passionate about maps. We would be happy if you would tell them about OpenStreetMap.

In addition to contributing to the map, you can help us by, for example, uploading GPS tracks, reporting errors, or promoting OpenStreetMap.

If you want to ask something, or just share your experience or ideas for improvement, we'll be happy to meet you on our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/osmkosovo).

Happy mapping!

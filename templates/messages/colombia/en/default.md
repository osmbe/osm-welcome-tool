Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

We noticed you made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap-OSM.
Congratulations, and thanks!
As of now, you can consider yourself part of the Colombian OSM community.
Your edit is live within a couple of minutes.
After that, you will have to refresh your browser to see your changes.

We want to be with you during this journey of discovering the world of OpenStreetMap.

To begin, we share with you some interesting links:

* We highly recommend using the [OSM wiki-pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
There you can the information that you need.

* In Colombia, we have a [Guide to map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Colombia/Guide_for_mapping) that explains in detail what can you map and how to do it.

* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM.
Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor (Java application).

* If you don’t find how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki.
In that list you can see all that you can add to the map.
At the beginning, this list could be huge, but by just taking a look you can imagine how can improve the map.

* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

If you have any questions like:
I think I might have broken something, or you’re in doubt how to map something particular, then you can use one of these channels to contact the community:

* The OpenStreetMap Colombian community has a [Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/osmco) where you can ask anything or to know the activities that they do.
This is an space where members discuss about different things about the map.

* For more complicated questions you can search in or post on the [forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org).

We also use several social networks, so you can interact with the community, and also find out about upcoming events, milestones reached or anything related to OSM in Colombia. These are the social networks we use for you to follow us and help us spread the word about the project:

* [X Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSM_Colombia).
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/osm_colombia/).
* [Mastodon](https://en.osm.town/@OSM_Colombia).
* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@osm_colombia).
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OsmCol/).
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13038204/).
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@OSM_Colombia).

So what should you map next?
We highly recommend adding features around you, like:
Restaurants, business, streets, sidewalks, benches, basically features that you know best.
You are the expert.
If you find a business already mapped, make sure the address is also mapped.
There is something satisfying about filling in the map around you.
Or correcting a road when the local government makes changes to it.
Do you have any special interests, like biking, hiking, or even trains?
Did you know we have the best bike, hiking and train world wide networks of any site.
But like everything else, they can always use improvements.

Happy Mapping!

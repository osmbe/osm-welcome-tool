Hello {{ mapper.displayName }},

Thank you for your first contribution to OpenStreetMap. 

We would like to warmly welcome you to the community of enthusiasts who have been integrating and improving the map for several years. 

If yours is a sporadic contribution, that's okay! Maybe you know someone around you who enjoys hiking, biking, or is simply a map enthusiast. We'd love for you to talk about OpenStreetMap. 

In addition to contributing to the map, you can help us by, for example, uploading GPS tracks, reporting errors, or promoting OpenStreetMap.

If you want to ask something or just share your experience or idea for improvement, we'll be happy to meet you on the [talk-it](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-it) mailing list. 

Find out more about the [Italian community](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Italy).

Happy mapping!

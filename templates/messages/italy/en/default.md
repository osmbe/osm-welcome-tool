Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I saw that you made your first edit on OpenStreetMap. Congratulations and thanks! You're now a member of the OSM community.

We don't only exist [online](http://osm.be/), but also [in real life](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/).

If you've got any questions, we can help you: if you think you broke something, don't know for sure how to map something, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, you can contact us.

Here's some help to get you started:

* You can find a lot of information about how to map on [the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/). If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for "site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]" with your favourite search engine. You can also browse through the questions on [the Help site](https://help.openstreetmap.org) or ask one yourself, or post on [the forum](https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewforum.php?id=29).
* If you want to stay on top of the Belgian community, subscribe to the [Belgian mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-be) or sign up for the [Belgian newsletter](http://osm.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cc6632a49e784f67574e50269&id=5c2416bba6) or chat with us on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+osmbe:matrix.org). You can also follow [@osm_be](https://twitter.com/osm_be) on Twitter, become a member of the [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/) or the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1419016881706058/).
* To see active mappers in your neighbourhood or to check out how much you've contributed, check out the maps and stats at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).
* There's also a [weekly, global news letter about the OSM world](http://www.weeklyosm.eu/) you can subscribe to. (It has an RSS feed for the fans.)

Happy Mapping!

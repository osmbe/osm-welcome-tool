Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

Please don't do test edits or add non verifiable features to OpenStreetMap. Your edit has been redacted. If you would like to become a valued member of our community,
here are some useful things to get you started:

* I highly recommend using the OSM [wiki-pages](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). If you don’t find how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki. For more complicated questions you can search in or post on the [Help-site](http://help.openstreetmap.org) or ask [the forum](http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewforum.php?id=20). Probably the best place to ask on on OpenStreetMap US Chapter's [Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/). Slack is a collaboration tool for OSM mappers, organizers, and developers. Slack even has our own #local-washington-State channel.

* [learnOSM](http://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM. Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.
* Want to see who’s mapping near you, or want to see how much you’ve been doing yourself, check out the maps at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).
* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

So what should you map next? I highly recommend adding features around you. Restaurants, business, streets, sidewalks, benches, basically features that you know best. You are the expert. If you find a business already mapped, make sure there is an address. There is something satisfying about filling in the map around you. Or correcting a road when the local government makes changes to it. Do you have any special interests, like biking, hiking, or even trains? Did you know we have the best bike, hiking and train world wide networks of any site. But like everything else, they can always use improvements.

Happy Mapping!

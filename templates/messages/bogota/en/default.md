Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed you made your first contribution to OpenStreetMapi in Bogotá.
Congratulations, and thanks!
As of now, you can consider yourself part of the Colombian OSM community.
Your edit is live within a couple of minutes.
After that, you will have to refresh your browser to see your edit.

I want to be with you during this journey of discovering the world of OpenStreetMap.

To begin, I want to share with you some interesting links:

* I highly recommend using the [OSM wiki-pages](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
There you can the information that you need.

* In Colombia, we have a [Guide to map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Colombia/Guide_for_mapping) that explains in detail what can you map and how to do it.

* [learnOSM](http://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM.
Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.

* If you don’t find how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki.
In that list you can see all that you can add to the map.
At the beginning, this list could be huge, but by just taking a look you can imagine how can improve the map.

* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

* Want to see who’s mapping near you, or want to see how much you’ve been doing yourself, check out the maps at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).

If you have any questions like:
I think I might have broken something, or you’re in doubt how to map something particular, then you can use one of these channels to contact the community:

* The OpenStreetMap Colombian community has a [Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/osmco) where you can ask anything or to know the activities that they do.
This is an space where members discuss about different things about the map.

* For more complicated questions you can search in or post on the [Help-site](http://help.openstreetmap.org).

In Bogotá, we have the [MaptimeBogota](http://maptime.io/bogota/) group that organizes peridic meetings, to map and to talk about the map.
This event is ideal for beginners like you.
Do not miss the [next event](https://www.meetup.com/maptime-bogota-colombia-osm/).

So what should you map next?
I recommend you to add features that are close to you and you know them well, like:
Buildings, restaurants, streets, sidewalks, pedestrian paths, benches.
You are the expert in your area.
If you find a business that is already mapped, you can complement it by adding its address, opening hours, social networks.
You will see how satisfying is filling in the map around you.

Happy Mapping!

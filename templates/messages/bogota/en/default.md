Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed that you have made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap-OSM in Bogot√°.
Congratulations and thank you!
From now on you can consider yourself part of the OSM Colombia community.
Your edits are already in the database, but some of them may not be visible in the maps yet. You have to wait a bit, or refresh your browser.

I tell you that you have started this journey into the world of OpenStreetMap, where you will discover many things.
You will see that it is very interesting.

To start, here are some interesting links:

* I recommend you to read the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:P%C3%A1gina_principal).
There you will find all the information you need.
All of us who contribute to the map continuously read the Wiki; and if something is not well explained, we document it there.

* In Colombia, we have a [Guide to mapping](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:Colombia/Gu%C3%ADa_para_mapear) that explains in detail what you can map and how you can do it.
I recommend you to read it, with that you are sure of what you are doing.

* learnOSM](https://learnosm.org/es/) is a good place to learn about the OSM world.
There are instructions for the iD editor (which you can use from the web browser) and for a more advanced editor called JOSM (Java Application).

* If in the editor you are using, you can't find how to map something, the quickest solution is to look it up on the [map features] wiki page (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:Caracter%C3%ADsticas_del_mapa).
In that list you can see everything that can be added to the map.
At first, this list may be huge, but with a glance you will be able to figure out how to improve the map.
Keep in mind that not everything that can be mapped is valid for Colombia; that's why I told you to check the guide first.

* If you have a web page and you want to incorporate the OpenStreetMap map, you can check this site: [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

* It's always good to know who is contributing to the map near where you are working, so you can take a look at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/). There you will see that we are hundreds of people working on this project.

If you have doubts or questions like the following:

* do I think I have damaged something?
* how do I map a certain thing that I can't find in the wiki?

Then you can use one of these means to contact the community:

* the OpenStreetMap community in Colombia has a [Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/osmco), where you can ask questions or learn about their activities.
It is a space where members discuss things around the map.
You can start by greeting the community, introducing yourself and sharing your interest in OSM.

* There is also [the communications platform Community (Discourse)](https://community.openstreetmap.org/), where you can ask anything, and have a wider audience.

* In Bogota, we have the group [MaptimeBogota](https://maptime.io/bogota/) that organizes meetings periodically, to map the city.
It is an ideal event for beginners like you, since we explain everything from the beginning.
Don't miss the [next event](https://www.meetup.com/maptime-bogota-colombia-osm/).
You can also contact us by [Telegram](https://t.me/MaptimeBogota).

* On the other hand, if you want to request the addition of a business, without having to know the mapping details, you can use the [minebusiness tool](https://maptimebogota.github.io/minegocio/).

Now you may be wondering what can I map now?
I recommend that you add things that are close to you and that you know well, such as:
Buildings (houses, buildings); stores (restaurants, hairdressers), roads, sidewalks and pedestrian paths; chairs/benches.
You are the expert in your area!
If you find a business on the map that is already mapped, you can complement it by adding its address, opening hours, social networks. 
You will see how much fun it is to fill the map around you with details.

You can also use applications like [EveryDoor](https://every-door.app/) or [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) to add to the map from your cell phone.

Finally, reply to this message or join one of the local channels, so the community can get to know you, and we can work together.

Enjoy the mapping!

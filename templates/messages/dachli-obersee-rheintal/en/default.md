Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

thank you and my appreciation for your first contribution to OpenStreetMap! From now on you can consider yourself part of the OSM community. Your contributions will be live within minutes; you may need to refresh your browser to see your contribution.

If you have questions, we'd like to help: If you think you've broken something, don't know how to map something specific, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, contact us!

Here are some useful suggestions to get you started:

* A good start into OpenStreetMap is the [Android App StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete#download), which allows you to easily complete your neighborhood. Try it out right away on your next walk!
* I recommend to use the OSM [wiki-page for Austria](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Austria) and the [Tips for Beginners](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Beginners%27_guide).
* If you can't figure out how to map something with the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is to look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Map_Features) on the wiki.
* For more complicated questions, you can ask in the [Community](https://community.openstreetmap.org). There is also a big list of [other communication methods](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact_channels) like Telegram, Slack or Discord!
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org/de/) is a good place to learn more about OSM. There are tutorials on how to use the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.

Have fun mapping and being part of the OSM community!

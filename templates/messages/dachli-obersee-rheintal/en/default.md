Hello {{ mapper.displayName }} and welcome as a new member of the OpenStreetMap community ðŸ˜Š

I'm very happy to welcome you here and hope you already feel comfortable in our big, worldwide OSM family. By registering with OpenStreetMap, you've taken a great step. Here you will find a vibrant community of people who are passionate about cartography and the dissemination of geospatial data. There are so many exciting ways to get involved - whether it's adding roads, points of interest, or even discovering and reporting map errors.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to help. Whether you're having trouble editing or just want to learn more about the different aspects of OpenStreetMap, don't hesitate to contact me.

The OSM community is very helpful and happy to share their knowledge. A great place to start discussions and ask further questions is the [**OpenStreetMap Forum**](https://community.openstreetmap.org). There you will find experienced mappers and enthusiasts who will be happy to help you.

As a beginner's tip, I'd like to recommend the [**Android App StreetComplete**](https://streetcomplete.app/). It's an excellent tool for filling in missing information on the map, and it's fun to use to explore your surroundings. Try it out on your next walk right away! For iOS and Android there is also the app [**EveryDoor**](https://every-door.app) that helps you contribute information about stores, buildings and addresses.

Again, welcome to OpenStreetMap! We look forward to mapping and improving the world together. If you need support or advice, I'm here to help.

Happy Mapping!

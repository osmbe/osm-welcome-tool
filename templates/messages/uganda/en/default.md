Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I saw that you made your first edit on OpenStreetMap. Congratulations and thank you! You're now a member of the OpenStreetMap Uganda community.

We don't only exist [online](https://mapuganda.org/), but also [in real life](https://mapuganda.org/events.html).
You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/osmuganda), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenStreetMapUganda), or join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/osmuganda) to connect with the other community members.

If you've got any questions, we can help you: if you think you broke something, don't know for sure how to map something, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, you can [contact us](https://mapuganda.org/contact.html) or join one of our [meetups](https://mapuganda.org/events.html).

Here's some help to get you started:

* You can find a lot of information about how to map on [the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/).  
If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` with your favourite search engine.
* A good start is always to check first if there is no error in the area you want to map, so you know if the error is made by you or a previous mapper ([documentation](https://learnosm.org/en/hot-tips/issues/#warnings-from-id-(issues))). You can enable this feature with `I` key.
* When you save your changeset, add a clear comment on what you have changed ([documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
* Do not connect landuse to highway, a field do not cover the road ; leave a small empty area between the two.
* If you have any question, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://openstreetmap.be/en/contact.html).
* There's also a [global weekly newsletter about the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/) you can subscribe to.

Happy Mapping!

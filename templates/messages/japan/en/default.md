Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed you made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap. Congratulations, and thanks! As of now, you can consider yourself part of the Japanese OSM community. Your edit is live within a couple of minutes. You may have to refresh your browser to see your edit.

If you have any questions at all, we can help out: if you think you might have broken something, are in doubt how to map something particular, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, contact us!

Here are some useful things to get you started:

* OpenStreetMap Japan community runs a [Slack](https://bit.ly/OSM_Japan) channel. Slack is a collaboration tool for OSM mappers, organizers, and developers.  This is a very active forum and the best way to get in touch with other local mappers in Japan.
* We also has [Twitter hashtag #osmjp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/osmjp) and [Facebook page OpenStreetMap Japan Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/osmjapan). You can contact us on those channels.
* Want to join Mapping Party? Check [OSM Japan website](https://openstreetmap.jp/) for details.
* I highly recommend using the OSM [wiki-pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). If you don’t find how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki. For more complicated questions you can search in or post on the [forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org) or ask in Slack.
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM. Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.
* Want to see who’s mapping near you, or want to see how much you’ve been doing yourself, check out the maps at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).
* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

So what should you map next? I recommend adding features around you. Restaurants, business, streets, sidewalks, benches, basically features that you know best. You are the expert. If you find a business already mapped, make sure there is an address. There is something satisfying about filling in the map around you. Or correcting a road when the local government makes changes to it. Do you have any special interests, like biking, hiking, or even trains? Did you know we have the best bike, hiking and train world wide networks of any site. But like everything else, they can always use improvements.

Happy Mapping!

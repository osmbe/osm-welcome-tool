Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

Congratulations on making your first edit to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in Laos! Thank you for your help making the map a little bit better.

I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, a fellow OSM contributor. Like-minded folks support fellow mappers from all over the world to keep improving the map. We don't only exist online, but also meet in real life, from time-to-time.

**OpenStreetMap in Laos** is an informal community of all global supporters and OSM contributors in the country - mappers and users alike. 

Here are some tips to get you started:

- We recommend going to the local [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Laos) for updates on local community activities and tagging information specific to Laos.
- Join the [OSM Laos Community Whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/HGoot25zEdMKu1D9C7TYXy) for frequent community updates.

- While the editing tools try to make it easy to find out how to map things, our [wiki pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/) have much more detail. You can find a lot of information about how to map on [the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/).  
If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` with your favourite search engine.
- When you save your changeset, add a short but clear comment on what you have changed. [More info here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments).
- Make sure roads connect to each other, but don't connect them to landuse such as fields or residential areas.
- To get a glimpse of what is going on around the world, subscribe to the [weekly newsletter about the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/).
- Keep track of your edits with the [how did you contribute tool](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/).

Have a Map-py Day, and we hope to hear from you in one of our above-memtioned channels.

On behalf of the OSM Laos community,

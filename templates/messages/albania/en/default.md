Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

I saw that you made your first edit on OpenStreetMap. Congratulations and thank you! You're now a member of the OpenStreetMap community.

If your contribution is sporadic, it doesn't matter! Maybe you know someone around you who enjoys hiking, biking, or is just passionate about maps. We would be happy if you would tell them about OpenStreetMap.

In addition to contributing to the map, you can help us by, for example, uploading GPS tracks, reporting errors, or promoting OpenStreetMap.

If you want to ask something, or just share your experience or ideas for improvement, we have a telegram chat were you can join [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+mXA7j_7smS4xM2Nk). 

Here's some help to get you started:

* [Welcome Mat](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/) gives a good overview of the What? Who? Why? How?, about and Working with OpenStreetMap 
* You can find a lot of information about how to map on [the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/).  
If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` with your favourite search engine.
* A good start is always to check first if there is no error in the area you want to map, so you know if the error is made by you or a previous mapper ([documentation](https://learnosm.org/en/hot-tips/issues/#warnings-from-id-(issues))). You can enable this feature with `I` key.
* When you save your changeset, add a clear comment on what you have changed ([documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
* Do not connect landuse to highway, a field do not cover the road ; leave a small empty area between the two.
* There's also a [global weekly newsletter about the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/) you can subscribe to.

Happy Mapping!

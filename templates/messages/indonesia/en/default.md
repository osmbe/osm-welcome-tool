Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

We see that you have made your first OpenStreetMap contribution in Indonesia. Congratulations and many thanks! You have now become a member of the OpenStreetMap Indonesia community.

Here are some tips to get you started:

1. We recommend you visit **how to map an object on OpenStreetMap**, and look into **Map Features for Indonesia guidelines** on this [Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Id:Indonesian_Tagging_Guidelines).
2. If you can't find what you're looking for on the Indonesia Wiki, you can look at Map Features in general on this [Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features).

4. For video tutorials on how to map OpenStreetMap at a basic or advanced level, you can visit this [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenStreetMapIndonesia)

So what else would you like to map? We highly recommend adding some objects around you, such as restaurants, offices, roads, shops, etc that you know well. Or if the objects around you are already mapped, you can add the information to make it more complete such as street names, house numbers, zip codes, etc. There's a lot of fun when you map the objects around you.

Happy Mapping!

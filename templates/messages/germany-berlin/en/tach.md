Tach and welcome to OpenStreetMap in Berlin-Brandenburg {{ mapper.displayName }},

You have been editing in Berlin-Brandenburg. Because it's hard to get started, here are a few tips and information:

- Everything is confusing? <br>
A look at the [OpenStreetMap-Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) sometimes helps wonders. You should be able to find most of the information you need to get started there. There is also [learnosm](https://learnosm.org/) which is more like a tutorial.

- We are a community. <br>
It may not seem like it sometimes, but there are many active mappers around you. 
The interaction in Berlin takes place in Matrix and Telegram groups. 
You are always welcome there, especially with questions or suggestions.
At [Kontakt zur Community](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Berlin) you will find the links and also a few more options. (e.g. the monthly regulars' table to exchange about OpenStreetMap topics)

- Newsletter <br>
Fancy some news from the OpenStreetMap bubble? Every week there is the [Wochennotiz](https://www.weeklyosm.eu) (subscribable)

- There's more. <br>
There are countless tools and sites that deal with data, special topics and users. Perhaps you might be interested in the [Verkehrswende-Gruppe in Berlin](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Berlin/Verkehrswende). If you interested in other tools and apps, feel free to ask!

Otherwise, have fun mapping and discovering!

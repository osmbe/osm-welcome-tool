Hello @{{ mapper.displayName }},

Congratulations on making your first edit to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in Thailand! Your contribution helps make the map better for everyone. Thank you for your effort!

If you have any questions or need assistance, we're here to help. Whether you’re unsure how to map something, want to learn more about OpenStreetMap, or wish to connect with fellow mappers, you can reach out through these communication channels:

- [Thailand Community Discourse Forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org/c/communities/th/53)
- [Thai OpenStreetMap Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/107441312638800/)

Here are some tips to help you get started:

- The [Welcome Mat](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/) provides a great overview of what OSM is, who contributes, why it matters, and how to get involved.
- Check out the [Thailand Wiki Guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Thailand) and the [Global Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). If you’re unsure how to map something, the [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) page can be very helpful.
- [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a fantastic resource for learning more about OSM. It includes instructions for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.
- When you save your changeset, add a clear comment on what you have changed. You can find more information on good changeset comments [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments).
- Keep track of your edits with the [How did you contribute to OpenStreetMap?](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/) tool.
- If you’re part of an organization conducting mapping campaigns in Thailand, ensure your organization adheres to the [Organised Editing Guidelines](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines).

So, what should you map next? We highly recommend adding features around you, such as restaurants, businesses, streets, sidewalks, benches—basically anything you know well. You are the expert!

Happy Mapping!

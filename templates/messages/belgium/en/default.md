Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

Congratulations on making your first edit to OpenStreetMap in Belgium! Thank you for your help making the map a little bit better.

I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, OpenStreetMap contributor in Belgium. We support mappers in Belgium to keep improving the map. Here's [some of our projects](https://openstreetmap.be/nl/projects.html). We don't only exist online, but also often [meet in real life](https://openstreetmap.be/en/category/event.html).

If you've got any questions, we can help you: if you think you broke something, don't know for sure how to map something, or just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, get in touch. There's a [lively chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#osmbe:matrix.org) (English, Dutch & French are spoken) where beginner questions are more than welcome. Also feel free to just answer to this message to contact me, or have a look at the other [contact channels](https://openstreetmap.be/en/contact.html) or join one of our [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Belgium/).

Here's some tips to get you started:

* While the editing tools try to make it easy to find out how to map things, our [wiki pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/) have much more detail. You can find a lot of information about how to map on [the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/).  
If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest solution may be to search for `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` with your favourite search engine.
* When you save your changeset, add a short but clear comment on what you have changed. ([more info here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
* Make sure roads connect to each other, but don't connect them to landuse such as fields or residential areas.
* To get a glimpse of what is going on around the world, subscribe to the [weekly newsletter about the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/).
* Keep track of your edits with the [how did you contribute tool](http://hdyc.neis-one.org/)

We have a wiki page to help new mappers get started. For more tips and pointers, [have a look there!](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Belgium/Beginner)
We do hope to hear from you, and meanwhile:

Happy Mapping!
